### [Chapter 1](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)
1. Perceptron: linear + *step function as non-linear*
	1. It weighs the input/evidence and outputs a binary decision (0 or 1). A combination of multiple perceptrons can represent complicated functions
	2. as logic gates
		1. it can mimic NAND, which is universal for computation, therefore *perceptrons are universal for computation* as well.
		2. However, perceptrons are better than gates, because we have *learning algorithms* to automatically update/change the perceptron as the target see fit.
		3. Good intuition from this [video](https://youtu.be/BS_CVhalVGw?list=PLxIHUhMHF8okwhq8poRuiHBChWjkVUHLL&t=1172)
