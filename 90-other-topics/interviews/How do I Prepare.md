## My best practices in technical interview
### General
1. ==Take in all information==.
	1. Read every word carefully. E.g., "exactly one solution" in "two sums".
	2. If multiple plots/variables presents, think of how they relate. E.g., one plot for total, the other for frequency
	3. Do not let anything seems abnormal slide, better still, describe what I noticed out loud. E.g., "there is a spike in the distribution."
2. When stuck
	1. try to abstract the problem and recall mathematical models/data structures fit *the pattern*
		1. E.g., "liar vs truth-teller" to sequential system
	2. Break down compound variable
		1. E.g., when ask for "frequency" look for info on "total" and "interval"
3. Involve the interviewer by speaking out my thoughts
	1. Ask clarifying questions, even if it's just to confirm I have the right understanding of the question
	2. Share initial thoughts/solutions to get their suggestions asap
### Additional ones applicable to coding interview
1. Visualize
	1. Manually walk through an example to gain insights. E.g., two pointers
2. Come up with more examples
	1. Examples counter to initial assumptions
	2. Simple examples whose answer is obvious to test finished code
3. Try recall data structures that fit *the pattern*
4. Breakdown into smaller *independent* parts. E.g.?
