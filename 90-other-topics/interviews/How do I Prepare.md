## Read before each technique interview
1. If stuck, it probably means my mind went to the wrong place, just *step back* and ask myself if I have done the following things.
2. *Use all information*
	1. E.g., if *multiple* plots/variables presents, think of how they relate
2. *Recognize pattern*: applicable mathematical models
	1. E.g., "liar vs truth-teller" vs sequential system
3. Break down compound variable
	1. E.g., when ask for "frequency" look for info on "total" and "interval"
4. Focus on structure
	1. clarify → brute force → optimize → code
