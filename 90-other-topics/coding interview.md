## General recommendation
1. Validate input first or ask if input is valid (saves time)
2. Write pure functions as much as possible
3. "If you are cutting corners in your code, state that out loud to your interviewer and say what you would do in a non-interview setting"
4. As a last resort, just try each data structure and see which one works

## Array
1. Arrays hold values of the *same type* at *contiguous memory locations*.
2. slicing and concatenating arrays would take O(n) time. Use start and end indices to demarcate a subarray/range where possible.
3. `subsequence` vs `subarray`
