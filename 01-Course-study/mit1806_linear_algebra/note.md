## Chap 3. Vector Spaces and Subspaces
1. Can even have spaces of matrices, as long as it contains zero and all linear combinations
1. **The system $Ax=b$ is solvable if and only if $b$ is in the column space of $A$.**
    1. In words, $b$ is any linear combination ($x$) of $A$
    1. Zero vector must be included for system to be solvable.
