## III. 1 Changes in $A^{-1}$ from changes in $A$.
1. Perturb $A$, how does $A^{-1}$ change?
	1. Three examples: $(I-uv^T)^{-1}$, $(I-UV^T)^{-1}$ and $(A-UV^T)^{-1}$
2. Two points
	1. rank-$k$ change in $A$ leads to same rank change in $A^{-1}$
	2. Instead of $n\times n$ inverse, just need to do $k \times k$ inverse, where $k$ is the rank of $U$ and $V$. 
3. Least square, adding new data
	1. Solve normal equation leveraging $A$, instead of the perturbed version.
## Notes to myself
