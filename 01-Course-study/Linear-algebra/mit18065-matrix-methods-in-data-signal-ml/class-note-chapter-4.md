## IV. 2. Shift matrices and circulant matrices
1. Eigenvectors of projection matrix $P$ is the Fourier matrix $F$. Eqn. 12 on P216
2. For circulant matrix $C$
	1. Same eigenvectors as $P$ since it's linear combination of $P$.
	2. Eigenvalues are components of $Fc$. Eqn 14 on P217
3. The convolution rule.  P218.
	1. $F(c\circledast d)=Fc.\ast Fd$
	2. Commute?
4. Kronecker for 2D convolution
## Notes to myself
1. Convolution in general
	1. It's always on *vectors/functions*! So does Fourier transform.
	2. polynomials
	3. functions
