### Generative Modeling
1. Probabilistic modeling as the fundamental mathematical model for generative model 
	1. ![[Pasted image 20250310164125.png|600]]
2. Generative is the mapping from simpler distribution to more complicated one. 
	2. Discriminative is $p(y|x)$ while generative is $p(x|y)$. Think of $x$ as simple gaussian noise to Diffusion model or prompt LLM, then $y$ can be generated bunny or poem.
	3. Classical discriminative modeling can be deemed as generative, i.e., from a 'class' to a 'distribution' which is more complex
		1. This also makes other applications, such as open-vocabulary classification, possible.

	4. Generative modeling of real-world problems ![[Pasted image 20250311084006.png|600]]
3. Conclusion
	1. Generative models have some deep neural nets as *building blocks*; they are the next level of abstractions
		1. Just like neural nets have some "layers" as *building blocks*
	2. LLM, Reasoning, Agents... will have generative models as *building blocks*
