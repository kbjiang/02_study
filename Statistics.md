## Statistics for applications Fall 2016
### Lecture 1
1. Probability vs Statistics, both stem from *randomness*.
	1. Probability: 
		1. simple random process, like rolling dice
	2. Statistics: 
		1. more complicated process; need to estimate parameters from data
		2. statistical modeling = simple process (what we know) + random noise (lack of info, randomness etc.)
2. What this course is about 
	1. Understand mathematics behind statistical methods
	2. Justify quantitative statements given modeling assumptions 
	3. Describe interesting mathematics arising in statistics
	4. Provide a math toolbox to extend to other models.
3. It's all about *replacing mean with sample average*...
